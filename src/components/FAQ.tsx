      question: "Do you pay for old electronics?",
      answer: "No, Communicycle does not pay for old electronics. We don't make money unless you do. Instead of lowballing you like a reseller, we partner with you to refurbish and resell your tech. When it sells, you get paid, and we take a cut â€” simple, transparent, and aligned."
    },
    {
      question: "How secure is your data destruction process?",

    {
      question: "How much do I typically get paid?",
      answer: "Payment amounts vary significantly based on the type, condition, age, and market demand for your electronics. We evaluate each item's refurbishment potential and current market value. You'll receive a detailed assessment and profit-sharing proposal before we proceed with any work."
